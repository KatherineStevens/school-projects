1. Lidar Data Analysis

This project uses Python code to read Lidar data and extract Right of Way (ROW) data of a 2 mile span of road. It then plots the longitude profile of the roadway from the edge of pavement to ROW, plots the ditch flowline, and finds ditch low point location and draws the cross-section.

2. Weather Data Analysis

This project uses Python code to read weather data from January 2015 - December 2017. It finds the average precipitation and minimum/maximum temperature of the whole data set. It then takes as input a month name and year and outputs for that month the average low temperature, percentage of days with average humidity below 75%, the mean daily precipitation, and the standard deviation of daily precipitation.
Note: This code was written intentionally without using statistics functions
